# sampling

Description

This assignment has a dataset regarding credit cards. It is a binary classification problem. The dataset is imbalanced and hence it is balanced by using random over sampling technique. After balancing the dataset, different sampling techniques are used and 5 different models have been applied to get the accuracy on testing set. The dataset is divided into a 25-75 ratio of testing and training set.

Methodology

Balancing Dataset
Creating different types of samples
Training different machine learning models
Testing the models
Analysing the Result obtained

Discussion

From the table, we can conclude that we achieve maximum accuracy when we apply Decision Tree Algorithm upon taking samples using the clustering technique. We get an accuracy of 99.62%.
